# ff-search
Python program that uses the reddit API to search a keyword in the new section of two Fantasy Football subreddits. It uses PRAW to access information from the API. It also utilizes a GUI through PyQt4. I have adapted this code and expanded it to be a general search function in up to 10 different subreddits. Check the subreddit-search repo for more.
