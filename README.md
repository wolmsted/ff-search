# ff-search
Python program that uses the reddit API in order to search a key word in the new section in two subreddits. It uses PRAW to access information from the API. It also utilizes a GUI through PyQt4. This is an early version. I am looking to expand on this application by allowing the user to input any number of subreddits which can be searched through for their keyword.
